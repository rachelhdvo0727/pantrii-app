But she has missed tofu of proper quality, and therefore she has started to make her own - from organic ingredients from Europe. Lê Trang wants to work in balance with our surroundings and our own health. This means, among other things, a low climate footprint and attention to the quality of the choice of raw materials.

The soy milk is then boiled up and when it has cooled down again to the right temperature, nigari dissolved in water is added to the right concentration. The soy milk then coagulates and when ready it is poured into molds where it is pressed during a specific procedure determined by pressure and time intervals. This gives the very special consistency that we and our customers appreciate.": "We use only three ingredients to make tofu; organic soybeans from Italy, nigaris salt from Japan and water.
